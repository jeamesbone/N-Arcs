N-Arcs
===============

The project portion of my honours thesis.

I implemented an arc based collision detection system in a python game engine and compared it to standard collision detection methods.

I began the implementation of a simulated annealing and genetic algorithm based method of generating arcs based on a reference image, but was unable to finish this due to time constraints.

Bonus!
------

Also included is 'N-Arc Maker' a small Dart web app that allows the creation of abitrary Arc structures for importing into the python project. This feature was dropped for the final project, but I think the app is cool.
