===============

The project portion of my honours thesis.

I implemented an arc based collision detection system in a python game engine and compared it to standard collision detection methods.

I began the implementation of a simulated annealing and genetic algorithm based method of generating arcs based on a reference image, but was unable to finish this due to time constraints.
